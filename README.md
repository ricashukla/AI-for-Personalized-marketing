**AI-Powered Personalized Marketing for E-Commerce**


**Overview**

This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze user behavior, predict purchase patterns, and deliver personalized recommendations and marketing messages. The goal is to improve customer engagement and optimize sales strategies for e-commerce platforms.

**Project Workflow**

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed customer interactions, trends, and engagement patterns.

User Segmentation (K-Means Clustering): Grouped users based on behavior to target specific marketing strategies.

Purchase Prediction (Logistic Regression & Random Forest): Identified potential buyers and cart abandoners.

Recommendation System:
Collaborative Filtering (SVD): Recommended products based on user preferences.
Content-Based Filtering: Suggested products similar to user interests.
Next Purchase Prediction (LSTM): Forecasted future purchases to drive timely marketing campaigns.
Personalized Messaging: Generated targeted promotional messages based on customer segments.

**Dataset Source:** [Kaggle - E-commerce Behavior Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mkechinov/ecommerce-behavior-data-from-multi-category-store)

Contains millions of user interactions: product views, cart additions, purchases, and timestamps.

**Technologies Used**

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras

ML Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Means, SVD, LSTM

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Deployment (Future Scope): FastAPI / Flask

**Results & Key Findings**

Purchase Prediction Accuracy (Random Forest): 94.3%

Recommendation System RMSE (Fine-Tuned SVD): 0.0179

User Clusters (K-Means): Identified high-value customers, cart abandoners, and new users.

Next Purchase Prediction (LSTM): Achieved 96.5% accuracy in predicting the next category.

**Personalized Marketing Impact:**

Increased conversion rates for cart abandoners.

Enhanced engagement with tailored offers.
